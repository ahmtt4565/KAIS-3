The AI engineer successfully enhanced the  application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more feature-rich and user-friendly platform. Initially, the focus was on integrating live currency exchange rates, a task that spanned backend implementation (API, scheduler, MongoDB storage) and frontend display (Dashboard card, dedicated calculator page). Throughout this, the engineer iteratively addressed user feedback, from minor UI adjustments (currency pairs, localization) to significant functional fixes (OAuth redirection, message deletion menu). Key architectural adjustments included adding  and refactoring  for robust API calls. The process was iterative, involving debugging frontend issues, adjusting responsiveness, and continuously improving localization. The trajectory concludes with the AI initiating work on a suite of new features requested by the user, starting with Report Listing, after having implemented historical data saving for currency rates.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested getting the  React/FastAPI app operational. Subsequent detailed requests include:
1.  **Live Exchange Rates:** Implement backend fetching, scheduling (initially daily, then 5-hourly), and MongoDB storage. Display rates on Dashboard and a dedicated  page.
2.  **Currency Converter Page:** Create a -like page with amount input, currency selectors, and conversion.
3.  **Localization:** Translate the currency converter page, navigation elements (DÃ¶viz to Exchange), and Landing Page sections (footer, How It Works) to English.
4.  **UI/UX Improvements:**
    *   Enhance currency converter page (modernize, then simplify, then subtly modernize again).
    *   Increase and alphabetize currency options in the converter.
    *   Ensure mobile responsiveness for Dashboard listings and AllListings page.
    *   Fix chat message delete menu to close on outside click.
    *   Remove transparent KAIS logos and enforce white background on Landing Page.
    *   Remove View All Listings button on mobile, make Featured Listings italic and bold.
    *   Shrink Instagram card on mobile and remove Go text.
5.  **New Feature Integration:**
    *   Add Exchange step to the onboarding tutorial.
    *   Implement user name validation: unique, no KAIS substring, no caps (admin exempt).
    *   Ensure password reset emails only go to registered users.
    *   Future features requested (but not yet started/completed): Small currency widget, rise/fall icons for rates, comparison mode, graph for rates (requiring historical data), block user, achievement badges, report listing.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently working on implementing a suite of new features requested by the user. Specifically, the immediate task is to implement the Report Listing feature. This task was chosen as the first in a prioritized list including Block User, Rise/Fall Icons for exchange rates, and Achievement Badges. The engineer has just started on Report Listing and has identified that the necessary  and  models already exist within , indicating a pre-existing structure for this functionality. The conversation paused with the user instructing to save all changes and continue tomorrow, implying the Report Listing feature is in its initial stages, with backend models identified but no further implementation steps taken within this trajectory. The backend is already configured to save historical exchange rate data, which is a prerequisite for future features like Rise/Fall Icons and Graphs.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the Report Listing feature, utilizing the existing backend models.
