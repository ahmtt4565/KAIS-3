The AI engineer effectively managed the  project, bringing it from a GitHub repository to a feature-rich, mobile-optimized MVP. Key tasks included initial setup, resolving a critical React 19 compatibility issue () that caused Google OAuth failures, and meticulously fixing the OAuth redirection flow. A significant portion of the work focused on enhancing the mobile user experience, such as implementing an onboarding tutorial, responsive UI adjustments, optimizing live support pages, and addressing display issues like duplicate logos and notification popover overflows. Essential features like robust password reset with Gmail integration and an improved email template were also added. Towards the end, the AI introduced advanced functionalities like pull-to-refresh, sophisticated image uploading, real-time chat typing indicators, admin panel access, listing sharing, and comprehensive profile photo management (upload/delete). The process was iterative, relying on logs, screenshots, and direct user feedback to diagnose and resolve issues across both frontend and backend components. The trajectory concludes with the initiation of live currency exchange rate integration.
